	<string name="designrestrictions">The motive has to be unisex, min. line size is 1pt, one colour, motive not bigger than 40 X 65 cm, only for the front of the shirt. It should be dynamic, young and linear. Don\'t worry - it doesn\'t have to be perfectly designed yet. It\'s about the idea!</string>
